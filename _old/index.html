<h2 id=""><a href="uhaul.html">U-Haul</a></h2>

<!-- <p>This is where design turned from making things pretty in Photoshop to serving real human needs. More than a few of my days as a designer were spent &quot;in the field&quot; helping customers and shadowing employees so that when we were designing tools and processes, we actually understood them as they really were, not as someone else had told us.</p> -->

<ul>
  <li>Researched customers and employees using location visits, user shadowing, customer calls, usability tests, user interviews and session logs.</li>
  <li>Designed and developed sites, intranets, apps, point of sale terminals and kiosks.</li>
</ul>
